OK, we're making an adoption app.

First make a database of pets

AND

a Pet Model

class Pet(db.Model):

	__tablename__='pets'

	id autoincrement int

	name required string
	species requred string
	photo_url optional string
	age optional integer
	notes optional string
	available required bool, default to available 


Easy enough! Let's look at that routing.

Route: GET / 
	
	should show a name, image and abailable if pup 	abailable


Next, create an Add Pet Form!

Route: GET /add

	It should feed into the Pet Model declared above, so 		don't overthink it.

Route: POST /add

	Should use above form to create new pet and add pet 
	to database. Redirect to '/'

Check validation... if form.validate_on_submit():

Then add other validations to form:
(the species should be either “cat”, “dog”, or “porcupine”

the age should be between 0 and 30, if provided)



Ugh, then we have to do some edit stuff...

Rotue: GET /{pet_id}

	Should take you to pet form with curr pet info in 	inputs

Route: POST /{pet_id}

	Update pet and redirect to '/'
